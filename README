hgc_background

Description:
Pattern recognition study to supress the background in the SoLID heavy gas Cherenkov (HGC) detector at JLab Hall A

Usage:
1. Directory on Duke physics server: >> cd /var/phy/project/mepg/by51/hgc_background
2. Install the needed python packages: >> pip install opencv-python scikit-learn tensorflow
3. Open the code in Jupyter notebook: >> jupyter notebook

=====================================
background events with with Npe>0 in hgc

SoLID SIDIS He3 run use 15uA beam
So there 15e-6/1.6e-19*50e-9=4.7e6 e- within 50ns time window

farm_solid_SIDIS_He3_moved_BeamOnTarget_0.561e10_skim_HGCwinCF1_pixel_matrix.ml
has 8800 good events from 0.561e10 beam e-
It's 0.561e10/4.7e6=1194 of 50ns time window
8800/1194=8
So for 1 signal event, you want to add 8 background events together into a single background event.
out of 8800 events, you can randomly select 8 to produce many merged background events

You can change 8 to 4 or 16 or different number so we know how algorithm can handle different level of background
